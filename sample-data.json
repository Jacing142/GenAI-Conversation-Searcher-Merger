Here are my top motivation strategies:\n\n**Set yourself up for success:**\n- **Start small:** Better to do 10 minutes consistently than 45 minutes once\n- **Same time, same place:** Build a routine your brain expects\n- **Prepare the night before:** Lay out workout clothes\n- **No zero days:** Even 5 minutes counts as a win\n\n**Mental strategies:**\n- **Track streaks:** \"I've worked out 3 days in a row!\"\n- **Focus on how you feel after:** Remember that post-workout energy boost\n- **Find accountability:** Tell a friend or family member your plan\n- **Celebrate small wins:** Reward yourself for weekly consistency\n\n**When motivation dips (it will!):**\n- Remember why you started\n- Do just 5 minutes (usually leads to more)\n- Change up the routine to keep it fresh\n- Focus on the habit, not the results\n\n**Reality check:** Week 2-3 might feel hard. That's normal! Your body is adapting. Push through those 2-3 weeks and it becomes much easier.\n\n**Final tip:** Take a \"before\" photo today. In 6 weeks, you'll be amazed at the changes - not just physical, but in confidence and energy!\n\nYou're making a fantastic investment in yourself. Start tomorrow and check in with how you feel after week 1!",

Better to have too much than too little!\n\n**Quarterly payment schedule (2024):**\n- Q1: Due April 15, 2024\n- Q2: Due June 17, 2024\n- Q3: Due September 16, 2024\n- Q4: Due January 15, 2025\n\n**How to calculate quarterly payments:**\n- Estimate annual income\n- Calculate expected tax owed\n- Divide by 4 for quarterly amount\n- Pay via IRS Direct Pay or EFTPS\n\n**Automatic tax savings system:**\n1. Open separate \"Tax Savings\" account\n2. Immediately transfer 30% of each payment\n3. Don't touch this money!\n4. Pay quarterlies from this account\n\n**Pro tip:** If you expect to owe $1,000+ in taxes, you're required to pay quarterly.
