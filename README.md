Search and filter your ChatGPT and Claude conversation history. Works entirely in your browser.

**[Try it now](https://gen-ai-conversation-searcher-merger.vercel.app)**

## The Problem

- Auto-generated conversation titles make finding old conversations impossible
- Native search in ChatGPT/Claude is limited and unreliable  
- Your insights are scattered across multiple AI platforms
- Teams using individual AI accounts can't combine their research
- Export files are too large to analyze or share effectively

## The Solution

Upload your conversation exports to search, filter, and export exactly what you need:

- Search across all conversations with keyword filtering
- Merge multiple ChatGPT and Claude exports
- Filter by date ranges and multiple search terms
- Export clean subsets as HTML, JSON, or CSV
- Team collaboration: combine conversations from multiple accounts

**Privacy-first: All processing happens in your browser. No data uploads.**

## Quick Start

1. Export your conversations.json file from ChatGPT and/or Claude
2. Upload (or drag & drop) the files
3. Search, filter, and export what you need
